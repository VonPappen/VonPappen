Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Paul Marmagne.

I'm a self-taught web developer.

My coding journey began in 2018 when a little algorithmic trading platform called Quantopian sparked my interest. 

My preferred programing languages are JavaScript and Python, but I'm always eager to learn new technologies!

Some of the technologies I use:

-JavaScript
-Python
-React
-Django
-Three.js
-Blender
-Docker
-Nginx

What I would like to learn:

-TypeScript
-Next.js
