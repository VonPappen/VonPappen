Hello! My name is Paul Marmagne. I'm a self-taught full stack web developer and I have been coding since 2018. 

My preferred programing languages are JavaScript and Python, but I would love to learn other programing languages.

I'm a passionate about creating beautiful user Interface and building APIs
